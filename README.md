What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering deals with the design, development, testting and deployment of software programs.
The difference between Software Engineering and Traditional programming is that; Software Engineering is concerned and extended over the life cycle of a software, from conception to maintenance using organized scientific and methodical approach. While Traditional Programming is centered around writing code to solve specific problems.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are the phases involved in Software Engineering. These Phases are

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1. Requirements: Knowing the requirements of the software
2. Design: Designing the achitecture, UI/UX of the software
3. Implementation: This involves writing tthe code for the software
4. Testing: This involves testing the code to see if it meets requirements and user demands.
5. Deployment: This is releasing the software for the users.
6. Maintenance: Continuous improvement of the software.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
1. Waterfall is used for project with shorter time frame, while Agile is used for projects with longer time frame.
2. Agile is open to adaptation, encourages experimentation and welcomes changes of direction. Wile Waterfall is a linear project progression, so it's best suited for projects with a defined end goal.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering (RE) is the process of defining, analyzing, documenting, and maintaining the requirements of a software system. It's a crucial step in the software development lifecycle that ensures the final product meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

PROCESS
1. Requirements elicitation: Gathering information from stakeholders through various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops.
2. Requirements analysis: Examining and interpreting the gathered information to identify conflicts, inconsistencies, and completeness.
3. Requirements specification: Documenting the requirements in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner.
4. Requirements validation: Verifying that the specified requirements are correct and meet stakeholder needs.
5. Requirements management: Tracking and updating requirements changes throughout the software development lifecycle.

IMPORTANCE
- Ensures that the software meets stakeholder needs and expectations
- Reduces the risk of project failure due to misunderstood or missing requirements
- Saves time and resources by identifying and addressing issues early on
- Improves communication among stakeholders, developers, and testers
- Enhances the overall quality of the software system

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a large software system into smaller, independent modules or components, each with a specific responsibility and well-defined interfaces.
1. Easier maintenance
2. Reduced coupling
3. Improved scalability
4. Reusability
5. Faster development
6. Better fault tolerance
7. Improved understandability

Testing in Software Engineering:
Testing in software engineering is the process of evaluating the quality, functionality, and performance of a software system or application to ensure it meets the required standards, specifications, and user expectations.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing: Tests individual components or units of code.
2. Integration testing: Tests how components work together.
3. System testing: Tests the entire software system.
4. Acceptance testing: Tests whether the software meets user requirements.

Version Control Systems:
Version Control Systems (VCSs) are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
